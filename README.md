<h1 align="center">Kroma</h1>

<p align="center">Kroma is a lightweight and powerful library for terminal output in Python. It allows you to set colors, text formatting, and more with ease!</p>

## Installation

It's super simple - just install it from PyPI via `pip`. **You will need Python 3.10 or higher**.

```bash
pip install kroma
```

## Why use Kroma?

Kroma is significantly better than libraries like `colorama`, and Kroma even has features that the very popular and powerful module `rich` lacks, such as:

- Dynamic color manipulation
- Powerful gradient generation
- Built-in color palettes
- Global terminal color scheme management (via palettes)
- Simple, intuitive, lightweight, and focused API
