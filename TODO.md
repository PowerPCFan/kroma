# Kroma To-do List

## New Features

### High Priority

- Make it so you can mix ANSI and HTML colors
- Write docstrings for quick reference without having to go to the docs
- Add more example output images to the docs (some code snippets are missing them)

### Medium Priority

- In Docs / Readme: Highlight USPs (unique selling points)
- 256-Color Support (8-bit)
  - Great for if you want a wider range of colors but need compatibility with older terminals / don't want to use True Color
- Inline markup like Rich
  - i'm not a fan of it but it's a very popular option

### Color Utilities / Helpers
- Contrast / luminance checks (is_light(), contrast())
- Color blending / interpolation (blend(color1, color2, ratio))
  - Similar to the lighten() / darken() functions I have right now
- Random Color Generation (random_color())

## Improvements / Fixes
- Break up functions and improve code in general
