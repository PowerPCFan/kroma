# Kroma To-do List

## New Features

### Extremely High Priority
- Clean up imports / structure (avoid any breaking changes)
  - Extremely important because kroma doesn't have too many users yet so it's good to fix this now

### High Priority

- Make it so you can mix ANSI and HTML colors
- Write docstrings for quick reference without having to go to the docs
- Add more example output images to the docs (some code snippets are missing them)

### Medium Priority

- In Docs / Readme: Highlight USPs (unique selling points)
- 256-Color Support (8-bit)
  - Great for if you want a wider range of colors but need compatibility with older terminals / don't want to use True Color
- Cache frequently used and/or heavy functions with @lru_cache to improve performance

## Improvements / Fixes
- Break up functions and improve code in general
